        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h2 style="color: red;"><hr>History</hr></h2>
        <p>TheUrban was started back in 2014 with an Idea to sell 
            techy products in the offline market with reasonable<br>
            price but it was a kind of local store in Surat. 
            For 4 years, TheUrban generated business from Surat<br>
            and then other franchises were inaugurated in different 
            cities in different parts of India for example Mumbai,<br>
            Delhi, Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Kolkatta .etc.</p>
        <h2 style="color: red;"><hr>Present</hr></h2>
        <p>At Present,  there are total 34 franchises of TheUrban 
            all over India and 2 franchises in foriegn countries,<br> 
            but keeping in account that internet is growing at an 
            exponential rate, an online platform is must in 2023<br>
            to provide for the costumers need, So we started an 
            Ecommerce Website where our costumers can buy and have<br> 
            their packages delivered at their homes without any
            inconvinence. We are trying our best to improve the<br> 
            online experience of our costumers for which 
            we can say TheUrban IS GROWING.</p>
        <h2 style="color: red;"><hr>What makes us different?</hr></h2>
        <p>There are many Ecommerece platforms all over the world<br>
           that provide the same service that we do, but the thing that makes us different is Trust.<br>
           we assure that our customers don't face any issue regarding their packages </p>
